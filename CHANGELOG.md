# ChangeLog
## [Unreleased]

### Kakoune Support
- Restore module support since packaged versions of Kakoune now have it.
- Fix filetype detection for removing parinfer hooks

## [v0.3.1]
### Changed
- Kakoune script can't use modules yet.  (Packaged versions of Kakoune do
  not support them yet.)

## [v0.3.0]
### Changed
- Kakoune script now uses modules.
- Published to NPM, usable from JavaScript that supports WebAssembly with a
  wrapper that works like the original JavaScript parinfer.
- Result from C wrapper is now in thread-local storage, allowing concurrent
  use from different threads.
- Files have been reorganized so that `cargo build --release` is now run
  at the top-level instead of in the `cparinfer` sub-directory.
- Tests now run on Linux, CircleCI now runs our tests.

## [v0.2.0]
### Fixed
- `>>` reindents the rest of the form
- `E121: Undefined variable: w:parinfer_previous_cursor` after `:split`
- `E122` after `:PlugUpdate` (#18)
- `E523: not allowed here`
- `vim-fireplace` compatibility:
  - Fixed error after selecting expression with `cqq` (#15)

### Changed
- Honors `g:parinfer_enabled` (instead of `g:parinfer_mode` of "off")
- Is disabled during `:set paste`

### Added
- `:ParinferOn` command
- A logging facility and the `:ParinferLog` command
- `g:parinfer_force_balance` option (defaults to off)
